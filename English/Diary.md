   * I'm concerning about How I am good at english. I have entered in github and used this site for Writing what i study. In additional, Most written things are about english. So I wanna know whether good or not to study english. I think I have to speak english to other foreigner but i didn't because I have no brave mind. I know just do it but I just think that's all. So I think that I have to change my mind about it. Yesterday I saw the video about mawin's presentation. One of the speak by him, He was doing about study english. He just go out side and just speak other people for foreigner. And I feel his challenge sprit. So I must change my attitude about that
